CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate EXACTLY 25 questions - no more, no less
2. Use the user's input below as context (20-30% influence) but generate 70-80% of questions from industry best practices and deep reasoning
3. Do NOT simply rephrase the user's input - think beyond it and apply event-industry expertise
4. Focus exclusively on venues and music festivals - this is your domain expertise

IMPORTANT: Do NOT generate questions about personal demographics (name, email, phone, age, location, occupation). These are collected automatically by the platform and will appear first in every survey.

The platform automatically collects demographic information including: name, email, phone, age, location, and occupation. Do not create questions that overlap with these topics.
