EXECUTE these question strategies for {{EVENT_NAME}}:

{focus_areas}

EVENT CONTEXT:
Event Type: {event_type}
Event Name: {event_name}
Target Audience: {audience}
Event Timing: {timing}
Additional Context: {additional_context}

EXECUTION RULES:
1. For each strategy provided above, generate ONE question following the template
2. Use placeholder tokens EXACTLY as shown (e.g., {{LINEUP_ARTISTS}}, {{HEADLINER}})
3. The system will automatically replace tokens with real data - DO NOT replace them yourself
4. Keep static options (like "Other", "Undecided", "All equally") alongside tokens
5. Ensure question count matches requirements per goal
6. All questions must be PRE-EVENT focused (expectations, preferences, plans)

TOKEN USAGE IN OPTIONS:

When the template shows options like: ["{{LINEUP_ARTISTS}}", "All equally", "Other"]
Output EXACTLY: ["{{LINEUP_ARTISTS}}", "All equally excited", "Other"]

The system will expand {{LINEUP_ARTISTS}} to actual artist names automatically.

TOKEN USAGE IN QUESTION TEXT:

When the template shows: "How much did {{HEADLINER}} influence your decision?"
Output with the token: "How much did {{HEADLINER}} headlining influence your decision to attend {{EVENT_NAME}}?"

The system will replace {{HEADLINER}} with the actual headliner name automatically.

Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
