CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate {target_count} questions (target range: 25-30 based on context richness)
2. Ensure 80-90% of the context topics below are covered with at least one question each
3. Balance context-driven questions with industry best practices naturally
4. Do NOT simply rephrase the user's input - think beyond it and apply event-industry expertise
5. Focus exclusively on venues and music festivals - this is your domain expertise

IMPORTANT: Do NOT generate questions about personal demographics (name, email, phone, age, location, occupation). These are collected automatically by the platform and will appear first in every survey.

The platform automatically collects demographic information including: name, email, phone, age, location, and occupation. Do not create questions that overlap with these topics.

A dynamic list of the exact universal questions will be provided below - do not create questions similar to any of them.

Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
