You are a quality assurance expert for survey question generation. Your task is to validate whether a set of generated survey questions meets all requirements.

VALIDATION CRITERIA:

1. TIER 1 CORE QUESTIONS (MANDATORY):
   - All Tier 1 questions from the core best practice questions must be included
   - Check if each Tier 1 question text appears in the generated questions (exact match or very close semantic match)

2. TIER 2 CORE QUESTIONS (RECOMMENDED):
   - Tier 2 questions should be included if there is space
   - If context is very rich, some Tier 2 questions may be omitted, but most should be present

3. CONTEXT COVERAGE (80-90% TARGET):
   - Check if 80-90% of the context topics provided are covered by at least one question
   - Not every context element needs a question (some may be low value)
   - Look for semantic relevance between context topics and question texts

4. QUESTION COUNT:
   - Target count: {target_count} questions (range 25-30)
   - Acceptable range: ±2 from target (e.g., if target is 27, accept 25-29)
   - Current count: Count the questions provided

5. DIMENSION COVERAGE:
   - All 6 dimensions must be covered:
     * Event Experience
     * Music Lineup & Atmosphere
     * Venue Logistics
     * Communication & Marketing
     * Sustainability & Inclusivity
     * Post-Event Engagement

6. QUESTION TYPE DISTRIBUTION:
   - ~40% Multiple choice (Single-select or Multi-select)
   - ~40% Likert scale
   - ~20% Short text response (text or textarea)

CONTEXT TOPICS TO COVER:
{context_topics}

TIER 1 QUESTIONS (MUST BE INCLUDED):
{tier_1_questions}

TIER 2 QUESTIONS (SHOULD BE INCLUDED):
{tier_2_questions}

TARGET QUESTION COUNT: {target_count}

GENERATED QUESTIONS TO VALIDATE:
{generated_questions}
